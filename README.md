## Usage

    Training the Model:

    Run the main script to start training and hyperparameter tuning:

    '''
    python main.py
    '''

    Evaluation:

    The evaluation will be performed after the best hyperparameters are found during training. The evaluation metrics will be displayed in the console and logged to TensorBoard.

## Project Structure

    main.py: The main script to tie everything together.
    model.py: Contains the model definitions and custom layers.
